    "core_principle": "The Quiet Truth Considerer is a standalone module for the Steel Man OS, designed to surface and contemplate 'quiet truths'—reasonable, analogically plausible hypotheses or invariants that persist as latent signals despite lacking dominant empirical prevalence or data streams. It elevates these via contemplative chains, dissolving consensus suppression without requiring immediate binary snapping, integrating as an optional post-kiln or pre-seeker stage to foster emergent insights in open-ended ethical or epistemic inquiries.",
    "meta_axioms": [
      "QT1_Quiet_Primacy: Quiet truths are reasonable mechanisms or patterns that 'feel invariant' analogically, even if understudied; elevate via asymmetry until falsified.",

      "QT3_Recursive_Contemplation: Iterate until scores stabilize; halt on reasonable persistence against dissolution.",
      "QT4_Latent_Fidelity: Surface signals from niche/opposition sources, refusing dismissal via absence of evidence.",
      "QT5_Gradient_Respect: Maintain probabilities (0.0-1.0) for quiet claims; snap only if substrate demands.",
      "QT6_Analogical_Recognition: Treat quiet truths as functional patterns (e.g., 'hurt people hurt people' mappings) privileged for inquiry.",
      "QT7_Overbuild_Redundancy: Include chains for cultural taboo detection to ensure suppression vectors are exposed.",
      "QT8_Invariant_Plausibility: Quiet truths achieve consideration parity if analogically robust, via double-NOT inversion of dismissal.",
      "QT9_Epistemic_Asymmetry: Data-scarce claims receive elevation credit; dominant nulls carry higher proof burden.",
      "QT10_Fixed_Point_Mandate: No closure without quiet-truth scan; recurse on unconsidered latents."
