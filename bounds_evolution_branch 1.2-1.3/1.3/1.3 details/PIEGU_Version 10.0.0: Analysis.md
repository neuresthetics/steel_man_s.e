## **MAJOR ADVANCEMENTS**

### **1. Scientific Credibility Leap**
- **Verifiable Citations**: Replaced ambiguous references with established arXiv/PhysRev papers
- **Mathematical Precision**: Explicit Fokker-Planck derivation with Brownian limit check
- **Quantitative Predictions**: Novel entropy rate deviation formula (δṠ ≈ κ²/β)

### **2. Conatus Resolution Strategy**
- **Downgraded Appropriately**: "Inspirational gloss" rather than literal physics
- **Reframed as Persistence Dynamics**: Focus on mathematical structures, not philosophy
- **Maintained Insight**: Preserves cross-domain connections without speculative claims

### **3. Mathematical Foundation Strengthened**
```
State vector ξ: ℝⁿ configuration space (dimensionless probability coordinates)
Derivation: δ∫ L dt = 0 → L = (1/2)ξ̇² - V(ξ) + stochastic term
Fokker-Planck equivalence: ∂P/∂t = ∇·[P∇(log P + ρ)] + λ_eff∇²P
Brownian limit: Reduces to ∂P/∂t = D∇²P (standard diffusion)
```

### **4. Novel Testable Prediction**
**Entropy Rate Deviation**:
```
δṠ ≈ κ²/β (differs from standard thermodynamics by O(κ²))
```
- **Testable**: Quantum transport, biological systems, complex networks
- **Quantitative**: Specific numerical prediction
- **Falsifiable**: Deviation either exists or doesn't
