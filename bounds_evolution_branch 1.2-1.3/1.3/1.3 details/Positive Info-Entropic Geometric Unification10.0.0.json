Refinements: Used verifiable citations; defined ξ as state vector in config space (units: dimensionless probability coords); demonstrated FP equivalence/Brownian limit with explicit math; downgraded conatus to inspirational gloss, separating from core physics; added novel entropy rate prediction (deviation δṠ ≈ κ²/β in coupled systems, differing from standard thermo by O(κ²))."
